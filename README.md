# GEOG5995 Practical Assignments
## Welcome to Nastazja's repository for the Programming for Social Science assignments. 

**Nastazja had no coding experience prior to this module. Skills for these assignments were learnt from a 1-week intensive course, several readings of learning materials and a few run-throughs of the practicals. This repository represents a final attempt of each practical.**

Assignment 1: This project is centred on the concepts of Agent Based Modelling and Object Oriented Programming. The model will contain agents wandering around and eating material (data) from the environment. 

Assignment 2: Will be an independent project building up a model from scratch, and will appear in this repository by 16 December.
