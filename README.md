# 5995 Practical Assignments
## Welcome to Nastazja's repository for the 5995 assignments. 

**Nastazja had no coding experience prior to this course. Skills for these assignments were learnt from a 1-week intensive course, several readings of learning materials and a few run-throughs of the practicals. This repository represents a final attempt of each practical.**

**Assignment 1:** This project is centred on the concepts of Agent Based Modelling and Object Oriented Programming. The model will contain agents wandering around an evironment provided by in.txt, eating material (data) from the environment and sharing stores with each other when in close proximity. There are also wolves which can eat the agents and absorb their stores. These behaviours are achieved through methods defined in the Agent class and Wolves class of enhanced_agentframework.py. An ouput of the environment is provided in file format named envout.csv. The programme also produces an animation with a GUI. When the GUI window pops up, the user must click Run Model from the menu to view the animation (agents are white and wolves are black, the environment changes colour where it is eaten). The programme contains code that can be commented in to enable modification of parameters from the command line. The code was written under Python 3.8.1. 

- *Final Enhanced Model* contains an enhanced model with experimental additional features and Practical 9 model for reference to a rolled back code pre-enhancement. 
- *Nastazja's website* can be found at nastazja.github.io. 

**Assignment 2:** Will be an independent project building up a model from scratch, and will appear in this repository by 16 December.
