# GEOG5995 Practical Assessments
## Welcome to Nastazja's repository for the Programming for Social Science assessments. 

**Nastazja comes from a neuroscience and genomic medicine background with no Python experience (until now!). At first computer language looked like *alien* language
but after re-visiting the lecture materials countless times, it finally started to click into place (hoorah!).**

This repository contains a step-by-step build up of code within Assignment 1 and it will contain an independent project in Assignment 2.
