# GEOG5995 Practical Assessments
## Welcome to Nastazja's repository for the Programming for Social Science assessments. 

**Nastazja had no coding experience prior to this module. Skills for these assignments were learnt from a 1-week intensive course delivered by Andy Turner, several readings of lecture materials created by Andy Evans and a few run-throughs of the practicals. This repository represents a final attempt of each practical prior to submission for assessment.**

Assignment 1: This project is centred on the concepts of Agent Based Modelling and Object Oriented Programming. The model will contain agents wandering around and eating material (data) from the environment. 

Assignment 2: Will be an independent project building up a model from scratch, and will appear in this repository by 16 December.
